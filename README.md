## About The Project

This is an entertaining and funny dice game for 2 players where the goal of the game is to be the first to reach 100 points.

Each turn, the current player rolls a die until they roll a 1 or press "hold" to end their current turn.
If the player rolls a 1, the player's turn ends and the player's current points are cleared. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to the current score, after which he can choose to roll again or keep it. If you choose to keep it, your current scores are added to your total score and the round ends.

## Built in

1. JavaScript
2. HTML5
3. CSS

## What I learned

In this little game, I also learned a lot about the possibilities of JavaScript, where anything can be achieved with DOM manipulation. It was interesting for me to create a game where you had to build a slightly more complex rule.

## Acknowledgment

Thanks to everyone who gives feedback on my solution. It helps you find new ways to code and find easier solutions!

## Features to implement ðŸ’¡ðŸ¤”
